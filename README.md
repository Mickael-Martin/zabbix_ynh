    * Configuration at install. SSO works. You can add your users in a group in Zabbix (for permissions/rights).
    * Only Debian - Stretch 64b supported actually.
    * Do not change the default admin user password. The user is disabled juste after the install but used to update templates.
    * The Zabbix server port is not opened by default for external monitoring (active agent).
    * A Yunohost template is imported and linked to the host "Zabbix-server" (127.0.0.1) for basic monitoring for YunoHost.
